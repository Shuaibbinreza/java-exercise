### ‚ùå **You Can't Use Primitives with Generics**

In Java, **generic type parameters must be reference types**, not primitives.

So this **won‚Äôt work**:
```java
Pair<int, char> p = new Pair<>(8, 'a');  // ‚ùå Compile-time error
```

---

### ‚úÖ **Use Wrapper Classes Instead**

Java provides **wrapper classes** for all primitive types (via **autoboxing**):

| Primitive | Wrapper      |
|----------:|--------------|
| `int`     | `Integer`    |
| `char`    | `Character`  |
| `double`  | `Double`     |
| `boolean` | `Boolean`    |
| ...       | ...          |

Use them like this:
```java
Pair<Integer, Character> p = new Pair<>(8, 'a');  // ‚úÖ Works fine
```

The compiler automatically **autoboxes**:
```java
// Internally
new Pair<>(Integer.valueOf(8), Character.valueOf('a'));
```

---


### ‚ùå **Cannot Instantiate Type Parameters**

In Java, **you cannot create an instance of a type parameter** directly like this:

```java
public static <E> void append(List<E> list) {
    E elem = new E();  // ‚ùå Compile-time error
    list.add(elem);
}
```

This results in a **compile-time error** because the type parameter `E` could represent any class, and Java doesn't know how to instantiate it.

---

### ‚úÖ **Workaround: Use Reflection**

You can use **reflection** to create an instance of a type parameter:

```java
public static <E> void append(List<E> list, Class<E> cls) throws Exception {
    E elem = cls.newInstance();   // ‚úÖ Works fine
    list.add(elem);
}
```

- The method takes an additional parameter `Class<E> cls`, which provides the runtime class information to instantiate `E`.
  
#### Example usage:

```java
List<String> ls = new ArrayList<>();
append(ls, String.class);  // ‚úÖ Works fine, creates a new String object
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**
- **`cls.newInstance()`** is now deprecated in favor of **`cls.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance()`** in Java 9 and later.

### üö´ **Cannot Declare Static Fields with Type Parameters**

In Java, **static fields** belong to the class itself rather than to instances of the class. This means all instances of the class share the same static field. However, type parameters are **specific to each instance** of a generic class, so having a static field of a generic type parameter causes ambiguity.

#### Example of the issue:

```java
public class MobileDevice<T> {
    private static T os;  // ‚ùå Compile-time error
    // ...
}
```

### üßê **Why is this a problem?**

- When you instantiate the class with different type arguments (like `Smartphone`, `Pager`, `TabletPC`), the static field `os` would have to hold values of different types.
- Since **static fields** are shared across all instances, what would be the actual type of `os`? It cannot be **`Smartphone`**, **`Pager`**, and **`TabletPC`** at the same time.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Conclusion**

To prevent confusion and maintain type safety, **Java does not allow static fields** that use type parameters. Instead, you can:

- Use **instance fields** for type parameters, which are unique to each instance.
- Alternatively, for shared values, consider using **static fields** with non-generic types, like `Object` or a more specific type.

### üö´ **Cannot Use Casts or `instanceof` with Parameterized Types**

Java's type system, due to **type erasure**, removes all information about parameterized types at runtime. This means that, at runtime, you cannot verify or cast to specific parameterized types because they are treated as raw types. Let's break down the issues:

#### 1. **Cannot use `instanceof` with parameterized types**

For example, this code will not compile:

```java
public static <E> void rtti(List<E> list) {
    if (list instanceof ArrayList<Integer>) {  // compile-time error
        // ...
    }
}
```

### **Why this doesn't work:**
- **Type erasure** removes the generic type (`Integer`) at runtime. So, during execution, the JVM sees `ArrayList` as just `ArrayList`, and it cannot differentiate between `ArrayList<Integer>` and `ArrayList<String>`.
- The set of parameterized types passed to `rtti()` will be erased, so you cannot check if the list is an `ArrayList<Integer>`.

### **Correct approach with `instanceof`:**

To make it work, you must use **unbounded wildcards** in the `instanceof` check:

```java
public static void rtti(List<?> list) {
    if (list instanceof ArrayList<?>) {  // OK; instanceof requires a reifiable type
        // ...
    }
}
```

Here, `<?>` indicates an **unbounded wildcard** (i.e., any type), and `instanceof ArrayList<?>` checks if the object is an `ArrayList` (of any type).

#### 2. **Cannot cast to parameterized types with specific types**

This code will not compile:

```java
List<Integer> li = new ArrayList<>();
List<Number> ln = (List<Number>) li;  // compile-time error
```

### **Why this doesn't work:**
- Type erasure means the JVM cannot determine the actual generic type at runtime.
- You're trying to cast a `List<Integer>` to a `List<Number>`, which is not allowed because `List<Integer>` and `List<Number>` are not the same type at runtime due to type erasure.

### **Allowed cast if types are known at compile-time:**

If the compiler knows the type, the cast may be allowed, as in the following:

```java
List<String> l1 = new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList<String> l2 = (ArrayList<String>) l1;  // OK
```

In this case, `l1` is known to be of type `List<String>`, and you're casting it to `ArrayList<String>`. Since both are the same generic type, the cast is valid.

### üßê **Key takeaway:**
- **`instanceof`** and **casting** cannot be used with specific parameterized types (e.g., `ArrayList<Integer>`) because type parameters are erased at runtime.
- You can check for the raw type (e.g., `ArrayList<?>`) or use **wildcards** (`<?>`) for more general type checking.
- **Casting** is allowed when the generic type is clearly known (e.g., `List<String>` to `ArrayList<String>`).

### üö´ **Cannot Create Arrays of Parameterized Types**

In Java, you **cannot create arrays of parameterized types** (e.g., `List<String>[]`). This restriction exists because of **type erasure**, which removes the generic type information at runtime. Creating arrays of parameterized types would cause runtime issues where the JVM cannot determine the correct type.

#### **Example of a compile-time error:**

```java
List<Integer>[] arrayOfLists = new List<Integer>[2];  // compile-time error
```

### **Why this doesn‚Äôt work:**
- Arrays in Java are of a **fixed type** at runtime, and their component type is not erased like with generics.
- If we could create arrays of parameterized types, it would be unsafe because the JVM would lose the specific type information and could not properly handle type mismatches.
  
### **Example of the problem with arrays of generics:**

If arrays of parameterized lists were allowed, the following code would allow mixing different types in an array:

```java
Object[] stringLists = new List<String>[2];  // pretend this is allowed
stringLists[0] = new ArrayList<String>();  // OK
stringLists[1] = new ArrayList<Integer>(); // An ArrayStoreException should be thrown,
                                          // but the runtime can't detect it.
```

#### **Why this would cause problems:**
- Even though the code compiles, if it were allowed, you'd end up with **type violations** at runtime. The JVM would allow you to store a `List<Integer>` in an array that was declared as `List<String>`.
- At runtime, this type mismatch would **not be caught** because the array type is erased, and the JVM cannot differentiate between `List<String>` and `List<Integer>`.
  
### **What happens with non-parameterized arrays:**
This is similar to what happens with regular arrays, where you can store objects of any type, but type checks are performed at runtime:

```java
Object[] strings = new String[2];
strings[0] = "hi";  // OK
strings[1] = 100;   // An ArrayStoreException is thrown
```

This happens because the array type is `Object[]`, but you are trying to insert an integer into an array that is expected to hold strings, which causes the `ArrayStoreException`.

### üßê **Key takeaway:**
- **Arrays of parameterized types** (e.g., `List<String>[]`) are **not allowed** in Java because type information is erased at runtime, and it would lead to **unsafe operations**.
- If arrays of parameterized types were allowed, the JVM wouldn't be able to enforce type safety during runtime, which could lead to **runtime exceptions** like `ArrayStoreException`.

### üö´ **Cannot Create, Catch, or Throw Objects of Parameterized Types**

In Java, **generic types cannot be used with `Throwable`** (either directly or indirectly). This means that you cannot extend `Throwable` or its subclasses (like `Exception` or `Error`) with a generic type, and you cannot catch or throw objects of parameterized types.

#### **1. Cannot Extend Throwable with a Parameterized Type:**

You cannot create a generic exception class because **`Throwable` cannot be parameterized**. For example:

```java
// Extends Throwable indirectly
class MathException<T> extends Exception { /* ... */ }    // compile-time error

// Extends Throwable directly
class QueueFullException<T> extends Throwable { /* ... */ }  // compile-time error
```

The reason for this is that the Java type system does not allow `Throwable` to be parameterized due to issues with type erasure. The JVM cannot handle generic type parameters in the context of exceptions since they are typically thrown and caught in a runtime environment where type information is erased.

#### **2. Cannot Catch a Parameterized Exception Type:**

Similarly, you cannot catch an exception of a parameterized type in a `try-catch` block. For example:

```java
public static <T extends Exception, J> void execute(List<J> jobs) {
    try {
        for (J job : jobs)
            // ...
    } catch (T e) {   // compile-time error
        // ...
    }
}
```

Here, the method `execute` tries to catch an exception of type `T`, which is a **type parameter**. However, since type parameters are erased during compilation, the Java compiler cannot determine the actual type of `T` at runtime, leading to a compile-time error.

#### **3. However, You Can Use a Type Parameter in the Throws Clause:**

While you cannot catch or throw objects of parameterized types, you **can use them in the `throws` clause** of a method declaration. For example:

```java
class Parser<T extends Exception> {
    public void parse(File file) throws T {     // OK
        // Parsing logic
    }
}
```

In this case, `T` is a type parameter that extends `Exception`. You can declare that the method `parse` will throw an exception of type `T`. This is allowed because the throws clause doesn't require the type to be instantiated at runtime, just declared.

### üßê **Key Takeaways:**
- **You cannot create, catch, or throw parameterized types that extend `Throwable`.**
- This is because of **type erasure** and the JVM's inability to handle generic type parameters in exception-related operations.
- **You can use a type parameter in a `throws` clause**, but not in `catch` blocks or when throwing exceptions.

### üö´ **Cannot Overload a Method Where the Formal Parameter Types of Each Overload Erase to the Same Raw Type**

In Java, **method overloading** is not allowed if, after **type erasure**, the formal parameter types of the overloaded methods would become indistinguishable. This occurs because type erasure removes generic type information at runtime, and the JVM can no longer differentiate between the types.

#### **Example:**

```java
public class Example {
    public void print(Set<String> strSet) { }
    public void print(Set<Integer> intSet) { }
}
```

In the above example, there are two `print` methods:

1. One that takes a `Set<String>`.
2. One that takes a `Set<Integer>`.

However, after **type erasure**, both of these methods will have the same **raw type** for the parameter (`Set`), as generic type information (`String` and `Integer`) is removed. This means both methods will essentially have the following signature after type erasure:

```java
public void print(Set strSet);
```

Since the parameter type is now `Set` (the raw type), the JVM cannot distinguish between `Set<String>` and `Set<Integer>`, leading to a **compile-time error** because the method signatures are no longer unique.

#### **Why Does This Happen?**
- **Type Erasure** removes the generic type parameters (`String` and `Integer` in this case) and replaces them with their **raw types**.
- Since both `Set<String>` and `Set<Integer>` erase to `Set`, the method signatures collide, making them indistinguishable at runtime.

#### **Workaround:**
To fix this issue, you could use **different method names** or **different parameter types** that retain their uniqueness after type erasure. For example:

```java
public class Example {
    public void printStringSet(Set<String> strSet) { }
    public void printIntegerSet(Set<Integer> intSet) { }
}
```

Alternatively, you could also use **wildcards** to make the methods more general:

```java
public class Example {
    public void print(Set<?> set) { }
}
```

This way, the method can accept any type of `Set`, avoiding overloading conflicts due to type erasure.

### üßê **Key Takeaways:**
- **You cannot overload methods** if their parameters will have the **same raw type** after type erasure.
- This restriction ensures that method signatures remain distinguishable after type erasure, which is necessary for the JVM to correctly dispatch method calls.
- The solution is to either **rename the methods** or use **wildcards** to make the parameter types more general.
