### **Key Points & Summary**

1. **Map Extensions**:  
   - `SortedMap` and `NavigableMap` are extensions of `Map` in Java.  
   - `NavigableMap` extends `SortedMap`.  
   - Both are implemented by `TreeMap`, which is a **red-black tree**.

2. **Sorting Behavior**:  
   - These maps **sort key-value pairs** based on keys.  
   - Keys must be **Comparable** or a **Comparator** should be provided when creating the `TreeMap`.  

3. **KeySet and EntrySet**:  
   - If using `TreeMap`, `keySet()` and `entrySet()` return instances of `SortedSet` or `NavigableSet`.  
   - `navigableKeySet()` returns a `NavigableSet`, which behaves the same as `keySet()`.

4. **Methods Added by SortedMap**:  
   - `firstKey()`, `lastKey()`: Get the smallest and largest key.  
   - `headMap(toKey)`: Returns a sub-map with keys **less than** `toKey`.  
   - `tailMap(fromKey)`: Returns a sub-map with keys **greater than or equal to** `fromKey`.  
   - `subMap(fromKey, toKey)`: Returns a sub-map with keys **between** `fromKey` (inclusive) and `toKey` (exclusive).  

5. **Views and Restrictions**:  
   - The sub-maps (`headMap`, `tailMap`, `subMap`) are **views**, meaning any change in the original map reflects in these views.  
   - You **cannot insert keys outside the defined range** in these views.  

6. **Example**:  
   ```java
   SortedMap<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
   map.put(1, "one");
   map.put(2, "two");
   map.put(3, "three");
   map.put(5, "five");
   map.put(6, "six");

   SortedMap<Integer, String> headMap = map.headMap(3);
   headMap.put(0, "zero"); // Allowed
   headMap.put(4, "four"); // Throws IllegalArgumentException
   ```
   - `headMap(3)` creates a sub-map with keys `{1, 2}`.
   - Adding `0` is valid as it fits in the range.
   - Adding `4` is **not allowed** as it is outside the `headMap` range.

This ensures efficient **sorted access** and **range-based operations** in Java collections. üöÄ

### **Key Points & Summary**

The `NavigableMap` interface extends `SortedMap` and provides additional methods for accessing keys and entries, queue-like operations, reverse-order traversal, and sub-map views.

---

### **1. Accessing Specific Keys or Entries**
`NavigableMap` introduces methods to retrieve specific keys and entries:

- **First and Last Elements**  
  - `firstKey()`, `firstEntry()`: Get the lowest key/entry.  
  - `lastKey()`, `lastEntry()`: Get the greatest key/entry.  

- **Ceiling and Higher Methods** (Greater than or equal to)  
  - `ceilingKey(key)`, `ceilingEntry(key)`: Returns the **smallest key/entry** that is **‚â• key**.  
  - `higherKey(key)`, `higherEntry(key)`: Returns the **smallest key/entry** that is **strictly > key**.  

- **Floor and Lower Methods** (Less than or equal to)  
  - `floorKey(key)`, `floorEntry(key)`: Returns the **greatest key/entry** that is **‚â§ key**.  
  - `lowerKey(key)`, `lowerEntry(key)`: Returns the **greatest key/entry** that is **strictly < key**.  

---

### **2. Queue-Like Features**
- `pollFirstEntry()`: Removes and returns the **lowest entry**.  
- `pollLastEntry()`: Removes and returns the **greatest entry**.  

---

### **3. Traversing in Reverse Order**
- `navigableKeySet()`: Returns a `NavigableSet` (a sorted set of keys).  
- `descendingKeySet()`: Returns keys in **descending order**.  
- `descendingMap()`: Returns a `NavigableMap` with **reversed order**.  

üîπ **Note**: You **cannot add new elements** through these views, but you can remove them.

#### **Example of Reverse Traversal**
```java
NavigableMap<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
map.put(1, "one");
map.put(2, "two");
map.put(3, "three");
map.put(4, "four");
map.put(5, "five");

map.keySet().forEach(key -> System.out.print(key + " ")); // 1 2 3 4 5
System.out.println();

NavigableSet<Integer> descendingKeys = map.descendingKeySet();
descendingKeys.forEach(key -> System.out.print(key + " ")); // 5 4 3 2 1
```
üîπ **Output**:
```
1 2 3 4 5  
5 4 3 2 1  
```

---

### **4. Getting Submap Views**
- **Customizable submaps**: These methods allow inclusion/exclusion of boundaries.  
  - `subMap(fromKey, fromInclusive, toKey, toInclusive)`: Get a submap with optional boundaries.  
  - `headMap(toKey, inclusive)`: Get a **head submap** with keys **‚â§ toKey**.  
  - `tailMap(fromKey, inclusive)`: Get a **tail submap** with keys **‚â• fromKey**.  

üîπ **Important**: These submaps are **views** of the original map. Changes to the original map **affect the views**, and vice versa.  
üîπ **Restriction**: You **cannot add** keys **outside the boundaries** of the submap.

---

### **Summary**
`NavigableMap` enhances `SortedMap` with:
‚úî More precise key/entry access.  
‚úî Queue-like operations (`pollFirstEntry()`, `pollLastEntry()`).  
‚úî Reverse-order traversal (`descendingKeySet()`, `descendingMap()`).  
‚úî Flexible submap retrieval (`subMap()`, `headMap()`, `tailMap()`).
