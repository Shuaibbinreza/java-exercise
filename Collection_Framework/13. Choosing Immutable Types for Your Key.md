### Key Points: Avoiding the Use of Mutable Keys

1. **Mutable Keys are an Antipattern**: Using mutable keys in a map can cause severe side effects, such as making map entries unreachable. This should be avoided in production code.

2. **Example of Mutable Key Class**:
   - A `Key` class is shown, which wraps a `String` and provides mutable behavior (via a setter method). It overrides `equals()` and `hashCode()` for map usage.
   
   ```java
   class Key {
       private String key;

       public Key(String key) {
           this.key = key;
       }

       public String getKey() {
           return key;
       }

       public void setKey(String key) {
           this.key = key;
       }

       @Override
       public String toString() {
           return key;
       }

       @Override
       public boolean equals(Object o) {
           if (this == o) return true;
           if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
           Key key = (Key) o;
           return Objects.equals(this.key, key.key);
       }

       @Override
       public int hashCode() {
           return key.hashCode();
       }
   }
   ```

3. **Initial Working Example**:
   - A `HashMap` is created with mutable keys.
   ```java
   Key one = new Key("1");
   Key two = new Key("2");

   Map<Key, String> map = new HashMap<>();
   map.put(one, "one");
   map.put(two, "two");
   System.out.println("map.get(one) = " + map.get(one));  // Output: one
   System.out.println("map.get(two) = " + map.get(two));  // Output: two
   ```

4. **Issue when Mutating a Key**:
   - If a key is mutated (its `setKey` method is called), the map can lose access to the original value because the key's hash code and equality check can be affected.

   Example of mutation:
   ```java
   one.setKey("5");
   System.out.println("map.get(one) = " + map.get(one));  // Output: null
   ```

   **Results of Mutation**:
   - If you mutate a key to a value that doesn't correspond to an existing key, retrieving values becomes impossible.
   - If a key is mutated to a value used by another key, the original key-value mapping may be lost, leading to incorrect behavior.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - **Avoid Mutable Keys**: If using mutable keys is unavoidable, ensure they are not mutated after being added to the map.
   - **Best Practice**: Prefer using **immutable keys** to avoid these issues, as their hash code and equality properties remain consistent.

   Example of an immutable key class:
   ```java
   class ImmutableKey {
       private final String key;

       public ImmutableKey(String key) {
           this.key = key;
       }

       public String getKey() {
           return key;
       }

       @Override
       public boolean equals(Object o) {
           if (this == o) return true;
           if (o == null || getClass() != o.getClass()) return false;
           ImmutableKey that = (ImmutableKey) o;
           return Objects.equals(key, that.key);
       }

       @Override
       public int hashCode() {
           return key.hashCode();
       }
   }
   ```

This ensures that keys retain their integrity and prevent unexpected behavior in maps.

### Key Points: Diving into the Structure of `HashSet`

1. **HashSet Internals**:
   - A `HashSet` is built on top of a `HashMap`. The elements of the `HashSet` are stored as the **keys** in the `HashMap`, while the **values** are placeholders (often a static object like `PRESENT`).
   
   ```java
   private transient HashMap<E, Object> map;
   private static final Object PRESENT = new Object();

   public boolean add(E e) {
       return map.put(e, PRESENT) == null;
   }
   ```

2. **Key Concept**:
   - In a `HashSet`, the object you're adding becomes the key in the internal `HashMap`, and the value is just a placeholder (`PRESENT`).
   - The important aspect is that **mutating an object after adding it to the set** can lead to unexpected behavior.

3. **Example of Mutating Objects in a Set**:
   - The previous example using a mutable `Key` class demonstrates the issue. The mutable key object is added to a `HashSet`, and later mutated.
   
   ```java
   Key one = new Key("1");
   Key two = new Key("2");

   Set<Key> set = new HashSet<>();
   set.add(one);
   set.add(two);

   System.out.println("set = " + set);  // set = [1, 2]

   // Mutating the object after adding it to the set
   one.setKey("3");
   System.out.println("set.contains(one) = " + set.contains(one));  // false
   boolean addedOne = set.add(one);
   System.out.println("addedOne = " + addedOne);  // true
   System.out.println("set = " + set);  // set = [3, 2, 3]
   ```

4. **Unexpected Behavior**:
   - After mutating the object, the set now contains two instances of the same object (`Key`), even though it should only have one unique key. This happens because the mutation causes the object to have a different hash code or equality comparison.
   
5. **Illustration**:
   - If you convert the set to a list and check if the mutated object is the same as the original, you'll see that it is now considered the same object:
   
   ```java
   List<Key> list = new ArrayList<>(set);
   Key key0 = list.get(0);
   Key key2 = list.get(2);

   System.out.println("key0 = " + key0);  // key0 = 3
   System.out.println("key2 = " + key2);  // key2 = 3
   System.out.println("key0 == key2 ? " + (key0 == key2));  // true
   ```

6. **Conclusion**:
   - **Do not mutate objects after they have been added to a `Set`**, as this can result in issues like duplicates or incorrect set behavior. The integrity of the object's `hashCode` and `equals` methods is vital for correct functioning in collections like `HashSet` and `HashMap`.
